## Dec 1, 2024
I'm stating the 2024 challenge today, but I'm also going back through my old code and adding what I still have from previous years. I (for some reason) used Google Drive to store my code for preivous years' challenges. I've changed computers a few times over the years, and several times bulk downloaded my entire drive to new computers. The result of this is that there's some days and parts that are just missing now. I plan to go back and re-write them at some point (he said famously).

I'm optimistic about this year. This is looking to be the first year that I can actually spend daylight hours writing code. In past years I haven't had access to something I can write code on during work hours. Combine that with commutes I was lucky to start working on AoC before 8 pm most years. This year I can arguably claim AoC as professional development!
